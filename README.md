# eFinance
An app to control the financing of expensive products, like cars, houses. Something simple that would keep the user up to date and more aware of his debts. 

## RELEASE 1.0
App successfully released. User has to register to use the app, features include:
* Login / Registration;
* Create Financing (if you want to simulate financing a vehicle or a home, you just have to input the basic requests);
* View created financings;
* Select what created financing you wish to view more details, like the amount due every pay period (weekly, bi-weekly or monthly).

### HOTFIX 1.0.1
Updated CreateFinancig.java logic, not allowing user to create a financing without filling all the inputs with data. Before this fix, the app would crash if a user created a financing without all the data required.

## RELEASE 1.1
New features added to the app. These features will help the user to manage the financing that was created, either to simulate different scenarios or to update values. The idea was to make it more user friendly resourceful.
New features:
* Delete financing;
* Edit financing;
